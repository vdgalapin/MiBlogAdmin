How to deploy to heroku 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_EO4RwABbA

Setting python environment - allows to help python dependencies
python -m venv venv -- git bash/every platform
source venv/bin/activate -- LINUX
venv/Scripts/activate -- windows

Installing FLASK
python -m pip install flask


Everytime adds a dependencies needs to update requirements.typing_extensions
python -m pip freeze > requirements.txt



I removed the '.' in the imports because heroku does not like it. It wants to call it from the root.
So instead of 'from .models import User'. it wants 'from models import User'


-- to pull in github

    Force git pull to Overwrite Local Files

    If you have made commits locally that you regret, you may want your local branch to match the remote branch without saving any of your work. This can be done using git reset. First, make sure you have the most recent copy of that remote tracking branch by fetching.

    git fetch <remote> <branch>
    ex: git fetch origin main

    Then, use git reset --hard to move the HEAD pointer and the current branch pointer to the most recent commit as it exists on that remote tracking branch.

    git reset --hard <remote>/<branch>
    ex: git reset --hard origin/main

        _Note: You can find the remotes with git remote -v, and see all available remote tracking branches with git branch --all.



-- To pull one specific file
 git checkout <branch> -- <file_name>
